# Global Emssion

## Description
This project analyzed global energy and emissions data to identify the most fossil fuel–dependent countries, assess the relationship between renewable energy adoption and carbon emissions, evaluate the impact of shifting energy sources on emission reduction, and explore renewable potential based on each country’s natural resources using Power BI.



## Dataset

•	Name: World Energy Consumption
•	Platform: Kaggle
•	URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption
•	Description: A comprehensive dataset covering energy consumption, emissions, and related metrics for many countries/regions over years..

## Analysis
🌍 Emissions are rising: Global greenhouse gas emissions more than doubled since 2000.
⚡ Fossil fuels dominate: Renewable energy is growing but still far behind fossil fuels, which remain the main source of emissions.
🏭 Top emitters: China, India, Japan, Russia, and Germany lead in emissions, energy use, GDP, and population.
👤 Per capita matters: Small countries like Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait have very high per-person emissions.
🌱 Low emitters use renewables: Countries with the lowest emissions rely more on clean energy and less on fossil fuels.
